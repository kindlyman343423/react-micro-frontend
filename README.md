# react-micro-frontend
React micro-frontend templates that support hot loading React micro-apps and components based on a users route.

### Getting Started

There are three React applications used by this POC. You will need to browse to each applications directory and run the install command.

To get started, clone the repo and run npm install to setup the dependencies. Then run npm start to launch the application.

### `redbox-details`
```
cd micro-apps/redbox-details
npm i

cd micro-apps/redbox-search
npm i
npm run build
```

### `redbox-search`
```
cd micro-apps/redbox-search
npm i
npm run build
```

### `host-app`
```
cd host-app
npm i
npm start
```
